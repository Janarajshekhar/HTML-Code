                Bringing up your child with proper attention to their oral health is a <br>
                lifelong investment in their health, which will benefit them greatly <br>
                for the rest of their lives. Early childhood cavities is a disease that <br>
                can ruin your child's teeth, even into adulthood, but it is easily <br>
                preventable. <br>
                There are a wide variety of steps you can take to teach your child <br>
                good dental habits, and one of the best is leading by example. <br>
                Make sure your child knows how much importance you place on <br>
                dental health so they know that it is something to be valued. <br>
                Brushing your teeth along with your child and letting them follow <br>
                your lead can be really helpful in setting up the habit of teeth <br>
                brushing in your child's life.
